# SolitonDynamic
This code is designed to study soliton dynamics by solving the 1D nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation (NLSE) with dual nonlinearity and an external potential, using the Iterative Power Series (IPS) method.
The original implementation, written in FORTRAN by Prof Usama AL Khawaja, provided 16-digit precision, whereas this C++ version extends the precision significantly, offering up to 50 to 100 digits of accuracy. 

    
                    i \psi_t(x,t) + a_1 \psi_{xx}(x,t) + a_2 |\psi(x,t)|^2 \psi(x,t) + a_3 |\psi(x,t)|^4 \psi(x,t) + V(x) \psi(x,t) = 0




You may need to choose your solution and potential. It is valid for single and two-soliton solutions.
